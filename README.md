## About this project

Phoenix DOOM is a project derived from the [3DO DOOM source code release by Rebecca Ann Heineman](https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do). The aim of this project is to allow the original 3DO version of DOOM to be played on modern operating systems, with enhancements and bug fixes to improve the experience while still preserving the essence of the original.
