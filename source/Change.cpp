        SECTOR HEIGHT CHANGING

    After modifying a sectors floor or ceiling height, call this

    sector.

    If crunch is true, they will take damage as they are being crushed
    If Crunch is false, you should set the sector height back the way it
    was and call ChangeSector again to undo the changes
