Possible original 3DO or PC Doom bugs:

- Anything that can be done about the artifacts when rendering flats when the eye is almost level with the flat?
- Wall sliding sometimes 'sticking' (may be original Doom behavior - investigate)

Bug happens in courtyard area beyond the yellow door (courtyard with red key).

- Investigate sprites poking through walls bug (visible on level 7 shotgun at start)
- Issue on level 10 with small crate textures (found this in 3DO version - data problem?)
