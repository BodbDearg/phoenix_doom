# Credits

Credits & special thanks for this port go to:

- **Rebecca Ann Heineman (Burger Becky)** for her port of DOOM to the 3DO and the subsequent source code release, upon which this work is based. It's almost a miracle that this version of the game shipped at all, given the impossible 10 week deadline and hardware constraints she had to work with - kudos for making it happen despite everything! Many thanks also for being mindful of this piece of gaming history and making it's source available online so that it may be preserved and studied by future developers.
- **John D. Carmack II (formerly of ID Software)** for being the amazing genius behind the technology of DOOM, Quake and countless other games, for his work on the Jaguar port (upon which the 3DO port was built) and also for being a strong advocate for open source and the extensibility of ID Software games. The game development community owes a lot to your contributions in general, thank you!
- **The former DOOM team at ID Software.** This goes without saying but many thanks to everyone at ID Software who worked to bring one of the greatest games of all time to life. In particular, many thanks to:
    - **John Romero** for being the driving force behind the gameplay of DOOM, for his revolutionary abstract level design and tools that helped make the game as awesome as it did.
    - **Adrian Carmack** and **Kevin Cloud** for their dark and demonic artwork that helped bring the world of DOOM to life.
    - **Tom Hall** for his contributions to the vision and high level design of DOOM, the DOOM bible and work on various levels in the game.
    - **Sandy Peterson, American McGee and Tim Willits** for their work on various levels in DOOM and DOOM II.
    - **Dave Taylor** for his work on the game code and the automap.
    - **Bobby Prince** for his superb soundtrack in the original PC version of DOOM.
- **The former team at Art Data Interactive** including the CEO Randy Scott, for commissioning the 3DO port of DOOM.
- [**Fabien Sanglard**](http://fabiensanglard.net) for his fantastic book _GAME ENGINE BLACK BOOK: DOOM_ and the equally superb black book for Wolfenstein 3D. Thanks for explaining how these games worked in such a clear and engaging way! If you haven't picked up a copy of these books yet, then I would highly recommend them!
- **The DOOM community** for their endless enthusiasm and for keeping the game alive after all these years. It's amazing to see so many new source ports and mods for the game still being produced in 2019 - keep up the great work!
- **The emulation & game-preservation community.** Thanks for taking the time to document and create tools for old systems like the 3DO and to preserve the history of games in general for future generations to enjoy.
