Below is a list of some of the main changes from the original 3DO version:

[] Improved texture mapping and renderer temporal stability.
Textures, walls and sprites are now much more temporally coherent and 'wiggle' around less. Texture mapping on the walls in particular is much improved and gets rid of the 'fuzzing' from the 3DO version where the y pixel values continously jump up and down on every wall column.

[] Framebuffer is now 32-bit instead of 16-bit.
This allows for smoother light gradients and less color banding.

[] Sprites no longer appear unnaturally bright.
3DO Doom seemed to light all sprites much brighter than the environment surrounding them. This may have been due to the lookup values that it used to light the sprites - perhaps they were too high? The darkness of sprites in this version much more closely mimicks the environment lighting and sprites hopefully blend in much better.

[] Fixed a bug with monsters often being very slow to target the player at range.
There was a bug in the 3DO code for monsters that caused very different AI behavior to the Jag and PC versions - now fixed. At longer distances monsters would sometimes be very reluctant to shoot at the player, sometimes taking up to a minute to do so. Monsters should be much more aggressive and challenging to play against now.

[] Added 'fake contrast' to walls to improve lighting and allow the player to identify wall corners easier.
Similar in concept to the original PC Doom fake contrast but works with walls of all angles, like options available in some modern Doom source ports.

[] Fixed some bugs with movement speeds & timing issues.
3DO Doom changed the timebase from 35Hz on the PC original to 60Hz but introduced a few bugs along the way. Some issues I've found and fixed include:
    [] 'Thing' movement due to momentum/velocity being too fast.
        [] Observed this first with the imp, with its super fast fireballs! (much faster than PC Doom)
        [] There was also oddness sometimes when corpses slid down stairs far too quickly.
        [] Both these (and possibly other momentum related issues) are now fixed.
    [] Pulsing lights cycling up and down too fast.

[] Fixed a bug where punching things made no punch sound.
Not sure why this happened, there was no code to play the sound in the 3DO version but the sound existed. Now fixed.

[] Fixed a bug where the chaingun muzzle flash was out of sync with the main chaingun sprite.
Muzzle flash now works correctly like the PC version.

[] Post processing FX is applied to the player's weapon in addition to the 3D environment.
In the original 3DO version the player's weapon was exempt from the invulnerability effect and screen tints. I added this change to help improve the immersiveness of the effect; looked odd that the weapon was excluded!

[] Screen tint FX method changed and minor tweaks applied. I switched from the 3DO technique of doing a blend with a solid color to doing a color multiply instead. The intent with this change is to hopefully help preserve color detail and prevent the 3D display from looking washed out when heavy amounts of FX are applied.

[] Removed the maximum screen size restriction.
No longer have to use a cheat to access this!

[] Fixed some inconsistencies in the simulation between high vs low framerates.
This could be observed on stuff like the view bob, where the bob amount would be large at low framerates but very little at high framerates.
To fix this I removed logic that simulates a variable number of ticks per frame and instead do a fixed time step update of game logic at all times (like PC Doom).
