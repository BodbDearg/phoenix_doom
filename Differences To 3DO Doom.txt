Below is a list of some of the main changes from the original 3DO version:

[] Framebuffer is now 32-bit instead of 16-bit.
This allows for smoother light gradients and less color banding.

[] Removed the maximum screen size restriction.
No longer have to use a cheat to access this!

[] Sprites no longer appear unnaturally bright.
3DO Doom seemed to light all sprites much brighter than the environment surrounding them. This may have been due to the lookup values that it used to light the sprites - perhaps they were too high? The darkness of sprites in this version much more closely mimicks the environment lighting and sprites hopefully blend in much better.

[] Fixed a bug with monsters being very slow to target the player a lot of times.
There was a bug in the 3DO code for monsters that caused very different behavior to the Jag and PC versions - now fixed.
Monsters should be much more aggressive and challenging to play against now.
