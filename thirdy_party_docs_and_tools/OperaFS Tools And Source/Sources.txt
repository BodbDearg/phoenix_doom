OperaFS[De]Compiler

'OperaFS' is a tool that can extract the contents of a 3DO disk image (.img) for Doom.
It allows extracting all of the files & folders on the disc into a regular folder, where they an be easily accessed.

Where OperaFS.exe (OperaFS[De]Compiler) came from:
    http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

Unfortunately there does not seem to be any source available for the tool, but the Russian page does link to some source code (for Linux I think) that enables support for the OperaFS filesystem:
    http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/downloads/others/operafs-1.0b2.tar.gz

I've included this source along with the tool the 'OperaFS' folder.

The version of 'OperaFS.exe' that I am using here appears to have come from here:

Was translated from Russian into English by someone.
