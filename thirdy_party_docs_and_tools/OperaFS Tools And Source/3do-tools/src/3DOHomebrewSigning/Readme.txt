* 3DO Homebrew Signing Toolkit version 0.6a by Charles Doty

This is the first public release of the 3DO Homebrew Signing Toolkit.

The tool will take an Opera formatted CD and sign it so that it will play on
a normal 3DO console system. The CD can be created with OperaFS[De]Compiler.
The CD will work with an emulator or on a real 3DO system.

The main purpose of releasing the tool is enabling the release of homebrew
software for the 3DO.

Usage:
------
To use the tool, type:
'3DOEncrypt isofile.iso' or 
'3DOEncrypt genromtags isofile.iso'

The 'genromtags' option regenerates the rom_tags part of the CD. This is needed
when using an iso created from OperaFS[De]Compiler; since it does not correctly
export the rom_tags part of the CD. The signing tool will fix up critical parts
of rom_tags.

Known Issues:
-------------
Probably will not work with images without a BannerScreen. A replacement
BannerScreen is included. Drop the banner screen file in the PARCE_ directory,
and rebuild the iso.

The tool hasn't been extensively tested with commercial software. Using
'genromtags' with commercial software could lead to issues. And, using
the signing tool with a patched or translated iso should work.

Addition Tools:
---------------
MakeBanner - Converts a 24 bit uncompressed BMP into a BannerScreen.

Usage:
------
To use MakeBanner, type:
'MakeBanner Banner.bmp BannerScreen'

Banner.bmp is a 24 bit uncompressed 320 x 240 pixel BMP.
BannerScreen is the name of the output BannerScreen file. Using OperaFS{De]Compiler,
this has to be named BannerScreen.

Tools:
------
OperaFS[De]Compiler can be downloaded from:
http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

There is an English version called 'OperaFS [De]Compiler [EN].zip'.

Another useful tool is 3DODiskCheck. It verifies a signed 3DO disk. 
Disks generated by the signing tool, will pass all of the tests.
